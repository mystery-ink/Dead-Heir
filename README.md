 
# DEAD HEIR
--------------------------


## Synopsis




### 	As the main character of this game, you start in a tutorial mode to explore the open world. At the end of the tutorial, however, you recieve the news of your wealthy relative's untimely death via phonecall from their attorney. The attorney informs you that you are the sole beneficiary of the entire estate - which includes several high-end FM Towers - and that you must come in person to finalize the will. 

###  There's no timer and the open world is left to the player until they decide to move out of tutorial mode and begin the Main Story sequence. Once the player arrives at the attorney's office they have two options.

1. Follow dialouge to see if there is anything potentially hidden or withheld in the scenes and mini games that altogether makeup part 1/6/ in story mode. There may be potential easter eggs, hints, maps, etc.

or

2. skip part 1 and immediately begin part 2 of story mode. 

## PART 2

### After an entire day at the attorney's office of very intensive financial management conversation and estate planning, the player has to drive home at dark with a busted headlight. Starting in part 2, the player can die at any moment. When you die, how you die, and all prior game play up until that point will determine the unique predecural pattern of gameplay for the rest of the game. For now, we will move on to part 3 with the understanding that it will be very differnt each playthough depending on each players style of gameplay. 


## PART 3


### Parts 3, 4, and 5 are 'choose your own adventure'-esque, with limitations of course. One thing is for certain though.. you are dead. you are a ghost. someone has swindled the inheritance and all assets from your newly aquired estate, and it's up to you to solve the case of your own death or else be trapped in FM purgatory back scatter for etenerity. 

### Time is of the essence (about 1 week in gametime or 4 hours gameplay). Whoever controls the estate conttrols the towers and therefor your only exit from this shit show of a situation. 

### The real challenge will be to stay focused and alert on your own case as, you are a ghost that can go anywhere (and any time) over the radio.. haunting people can be addictive and you should always Haunt Responsibly. Rememebr, if you don't solve the case of your own death, you may be stuck in parts 3-5 for eternity. and let's just say it gets....weird if someone else comes into possesion of the towers and estate...ya weird to say the least. 

## Part 6


### If you are able to make peace with your death over the course of your story, then congradulations! you are totally free to leave this world and claim your game stats

or

### explore the totally open Hauntable world in Free Play. You never know who you may find yourself haunting or haunting WITH! There's also a huge potential for multiplayer/online Arena stlye hauntings, personalized ghost avatars, custom haunting abilities, track records, and so much more!
